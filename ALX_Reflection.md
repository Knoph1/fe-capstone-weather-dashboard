# ALX Front-End Web Development Capstone Reflection
### Project: Weather Dashboard  
**Author:** Knoph O. Ayieko  
**Date:** October 2025  

### 1. What I Built
The Weather Dashboard is a dynamic and responsive web application that allows users to search, view, and monitor weather forecasts for any global city. It leverages the OpenWeatherMap API to deliver real-time weather data, hourly and daily forecasts and condition-based visuals, wrapped in a clean, modern interface.

### 2. Tools & Technologies
- **Framework:** React + Vite  
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS  
- **Deployment:** Vercel  
- **API:** OpenWeatherMap (REST API)  
- **Package Manager:** pnpm  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub  

### 3. Challenges & Solutions
- **API Response Handling:** Managing undefined or empty responses for invalid cities was solved by conditional rendering and friendly error messages.  
- **Responsive Design:** Implemented Tailwind’s responsive utilities to optimize the UI for mobile, tablet and desktop.  
- **Performance:** Used memoization and code-splitting to improve loading speed and avoid unnecessary re-renders.

### 4. Lessons Learned
- Structuring React components for scalability and readability.  
- Importance of version control and commit discipline.  
- Handling API keys securely with `.env.local` and environment variables.  
- Improved understanding of asynchronous JavaScript and state management in modern UIs.

### 5. What I’m Most Proud Of
Creating a visually appealing and technically functional dashboard that is both user-friendly and production-ready.

### 6. Next Steps
Integrate user authentication, add location-based auto-suggestions and expand to include additional environmental metrics (air quality, humidity trends, etc.).
